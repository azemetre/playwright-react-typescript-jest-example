### [problem](#problem)
It is common for many projects to use [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) for writing E2E tests in order to cover all functionality for users.

What are E2E tests?

> Typically these will run the entire application (both frontend and backend) and your test will interact with the app just like a typical user would

While Cypress has recently started to include [multi-browser support](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/02/06/introducing-firefox-and-edge-support-in-cypress-4-0/), there's still an issue of veryifying scenarios across browsers such as webkit for Apple products.

We need a way to easily verify and test behaviors across browsers. If we have a user scenario that fails for on iOS devices, we need to be able to write a regression test for it.
